    </footer>
    <p class="text_color">1.What is C Language?</p>
    <p>C programming language, the pioneer of programming languages, is a procedural programming language. Dennis
        Ritchie created it as a system programming language for writing operating systems. It is one of the most popular
        programming languages because of its structure, high-level abstraction, machine-independent feature, etc. and is
        a great starting point for anyone wanting to get into coding.</p>
    <p class="text_color">2. What are the features of the C language?</p>
    <p>It is Simple And Efficient</p>
    <p>C language is portable or Machine Independent.</p>
    <p>C is a mid-level Programming Language.</p>
    <p>It is a structured Programming Language.</p>
    <p>It has a function-rich library.</p>
    <p class="text_color">3. What is a token?</p>
    <p>The individual elements of a program are called Tokens. There are following 6 types of tokens are available in C:
    </p>
    <p>Identifiers,
        Keywords,
        Constants,
        Operators,
        Special Characters,
        Strings</p>
    <p class="text_color">4. What is the use of printf() and scanf() functions? Also explain format specifiers?</p>
    <p>printf() is used to print the output on the display.</p>
    <p>scanf() is used to read formatted data from the keyboard. </p>
    <p>Some datatype format specifiers for both printing and scanning purposes are as follows:</p>
    <p>%d: It's a datatype format specifier for printing and scanning an integer value.</p>
    <p>%s: It's a datatype format specifier for printing and scanning a string. </p>
    <p>%c: It's a datatype format specifier for displaying and scanning a character value.

    </p>
    <p>%f: The datatype format specifier %f is used to display and scan a float value.</p>
    <p class="text_color">5. What's the value of the expression 5["abxdef"]?</p>
    <p>The answer is 'f'.</p>

    <p>Explanation: The string mentioned "abxdef" is an array, and the expression is equal to "abxdef"[5]. Why is the
        inside-out expression equivalent? Because a[b] is equivalent to *(a + b) which is equivalent to *(b + a) which
        is equivalent to b[a].</p>

    <p class="text_color"> 6. What is a built-in function in C?</p>
    <p>The most commonly used built-in functions in C are scanf(), printf(), strcpy, strlwr, strcmp, strlen, strcat, and
        many more.

        Built-function is also known as library functions that are provided by the system to make the life of a
        developer easy by assisting them to do certain commonly used predefined tasks. For example, if you need to print
        output or your program into the terminal, we use printf() in C.</p>

    <p class="text_color">7. What is a Preprocessor</p>
    <p>A preprocessor is a software program that processes a source file before sending it to be compiled. Inclusion of
        header files, macro expansions, conditional compilation, and line control are all possible with the
        preprocessor.</p>
